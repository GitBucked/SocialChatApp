# 📄 Full-Stack Starter Template  

## Node.js • React (Vite + TypeScript) • MySQL • Sequelize

This repository is a reusable **full-stack starter template** designed to simplify project setup for future applications. It provides a ready-to-use structure for building modern web apps using **React** on the frontend and **Node.js + Express** on the backend, with **MySQL** as the database and **Sequelize** as the ORM.

## 🚀 Tech Stack Overview

### **Frontend (Client)**

- **React** – Component-based UI library  
- **Vite** – Lightning-fast build tool  
- **TypeScript** – Static typing for improved reliability  
- **Husky** – Pre-commit Git hooks  
- **Prettier** – Automated code formatting  
- **ESLint** – Code linting (included with Vite + React)

The client folder is preconfigured for clean code, type safety, and smooth development.
